# Battleships

Battleships is a game of logic, with players attempting to sink each others fleet by guessing co-ordinates.
This version uses a a board generated using Python lists and incorporates a logic engine to allow the computer to fire back at the user.

## Project Goals 
The project goal is to create a logic game using Python.

### User Goals
The application user wants to play a logic game.

### Site Owner Goals
The Battleships game is played on grids on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players call shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer.

## User Experience

### Target Audience
- Younger users who like playing games.
- Users who are looking for a game to pass time on during a break.
- Older users who are looking for a logic challenge.

### User Stories
- To have an immersive experience.
- To be able to play the game against a computer opponent.
- To be told when the game has been won or lost.
- To be able to easily replay the game if wanted.

## Battlefleet Game Instructions

Welcome to Battlefleets, Admiral! Your mission is to lead your fleet against the enemy and sink all their warships before they sink yours. The game is played on a 9x9 grid, with each square identified by a letter (A-I) and a number (1-9). Your fleet consists of 8 warships strategically placed on the grid. The enemy fleet is also positioned randomly.

### Main Screen
When you start the game, you'll be greeted with the main screen, featuring an ASCII art dashboard and instructions to start the game. Take a moment to review the fleet and prepare for battle.

### Game Board
The game board consists of two main components:

User Board: Displays your fleet's positions.
Target Board: Tracks your shots and enemy hits.

### Game_Play

User Turn: You have a limited number of missiles (32) to target enemy warships. Enter the coordinates where you want to launch a missile. For example, input "A" and "5" to target the square in the first row and fifth column.

Hit or Miss: The game will inform you whether your shot hit an enemy warship or missed. If you hit, the enemy warship is sunk. Keep an eye on your remaining missiles.

Enemy Turn: After your turn, the enemy will retaliate. The computer will randomly target one of your squares. The game will notify you if the enemy hit one of your warships.

Victory or Defeat: The game continues until either you sink all enemy warships (Victory) or the enemy sinks all of your warships (Defeat). If you run out of missiles, the enemy fleet escapes.

Game Over
When the game concludes, a "Game Over" message will appear. You'll be prompted to play again or exit. Enter 'Y' to restart and 'N' to exit the game.

Have Fun Admiral!
Now that you know the rules, it's time to lead your fleet to victory! Good luck, Admiral, and may the seas be in your favor!

- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html?highlight=random#module)
-random-`random.choice` is used to select arandom word for the game from a text file.
- [gspread](https://pypi.org/project/gspread/): to allow communication with Google Sheets. 
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html):  used to validate credentials and grant access to google service accounts.

### Programs Used

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used for version control.
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) -  used to deploy the live project.
- [Diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net) -  used to create the game flowchart
- [Code institute Herokuapp](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) used to validate pop Issues

## Testing

### PEP8 Testing
At the time of creation, the PEP8 online Python validation website was inoperative. To validate the code, a PEP8 validator that is built into the GitPod Workspace was used.

- Run the command 'pip3 install pycodestyle'. (Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.)
- In the workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
- Type the word 'linter' into the search bar that appears. 
- Click on 'Python: Select Linter' from the filtered results.
- Select 'pycodestyle' from the list.
- PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside the terminal.

### Code institute Herokuapp
The python files have all been passed through [Code institute Herokuapp](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#). All python files were checked with no errors reported. See screen show below:

## Deployment
The site was deployed via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), and the live link can be found here: [Battleships-Game](https://pp3-battleships-cae1b33910a6.herokuapp.com/)

Before deploying to Heroku pip3 freeze > requirements.txt was used to add all the dependencies required to the requirements.txt file. This is required for the game to run on Heroku.

The following steps were then taken:
1. Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
2. On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
3. Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
4. Next select your region.
5. Click on the Create App button.
6. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to Config Vars.
7. Click Reveal Config Vars and enter port into the Key box and 8000 into the Value box and click the Add button.
8. Input CREDS and the content of your Google Sheet API creds file as another config var and click add.
9. In the next Key box enter OXFORD_API_APP_ID and add your unique ID to the value box. 
10. In the next Key box enter OXFORD_API_APP_KEY and add your unique key to the value box. 
11. Next, scroll down to the Buildpack section click Add Buildpack select Python and click Save Changes
12. Repeat step 11 to add node.js. Note: The Buildpacks must be in the correct order. If not click and drag them to move into the correct order.
13. Scroll to the top of the page and choose the Deploy tab.
14. Select Github as the deployment method.
15. Confirm you want to connect to GitHub.
16. Search for the repository name and click the connect button.
17. Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the repo is updated.
18. Click View to view the deployed site.

The site is now live and operational.
